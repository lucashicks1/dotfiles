# Plugins

This folder houses all of my nvim plugins. Here is a (hopefully up-to-date) list of the plugins and where they belong.

## Languages

These are the files responsible for all of the language *stuff*. Generally, if you want to add another language to the config, these are the places that you go.

- `debug.lua`
- `formatting.lua`
- `linting.lua`
- `lsp.lua`
- `treesitter.lua`
- `mason.lua`

## Navigation

These are the navigation plugin files:

- `oil.lua` <- probably the best plugin out there (editing your directory like a buffer is crazy cool)
- `barbar.lua`

## Editor Stuff

The rest of these are just kinda there.
